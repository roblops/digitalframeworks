In this chart, I took information from a recent poll taken by YouGov and The Economist on American opinions about the upcoming elections.

But no one is quite sure of how likely things are to change. Most voters think the party breakdown for the next Congress is a toss-up. Less than a quarter of Americans have strong opinions on whether Democrats or Republicans will win the majority in 2018.
Last week, Inside Elections rated 68 Republican seats “vulnerable,” compared to just 10 vulnerable Democratic seats. This shift is common for “wave” elections after a party change in the executive branch.

Republicans gained 63 seats following Obama’s election in 2010. Similarly, Democrats gained 30 seats in the 2006 Congressional races following Bush’s re-election.

The poll sampled 1,500 U.S. adults from May 20 through May 22 in a web-based interview survey generating results with a 3 percent margin of error. The sample was weighted based on gender, age, race, education, 2012 and 2016 Presidential votes and non-votes.
