For this assignment, I looked at what cities Trump donors are most commonly found, and the distribution throughout the country. In making a pivot table, I first cleaned up some of the data by sorting out values that were made to parties other than Trump and Trump-affiliated businesses (i.e. Charles Trump. businesses within Trump hotels, et cetera) before looking at where money found in this dataset goes. I then found the averages for each city's contributions, and sorted them once more by what specifically they were funding.

Overall, Hicksville, NY had the largest average reportings from this campaign finance data. The second largest was from New York City itself. While both of these findings were not surprising, what was interesting to see was the distribution of donations throughout the country. As expected, Washington, D.C. and Bedminster, NJ were close runners up on the east coast for campaign contributions but Rancho Palos Verdes, CA, Miami, FL and Chicago, IL all had a large presence in this data as well. While these are Trump property locations, most donors outside of the east coast devoted money directly to Trump-supporting groups.
