Hello,

I want to answer whether the national exchange rates have changed as more genetically modified foods become more common. To do this, I plan to examine 2 sets of data from the USDA: one on [the annual internation exchange rate](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/agricultural-exchange-rate-data-set/) and one on [the adoption of Genetically Engineered Crops](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-us/). All of the data sets are provided by the U.S. government, and do not have any outlying numbers from an initial glance. 

However, organizing this data in a way that makes sense to draw correlations is still a problem. In the GMO data set, I plan to look at the corn and soy datasets and compare them to the cost information on major agricultural trade partners with the United States. While the GMO dataset has a lot of information by year, separating what countries I should specifically look at for food exports may take some time. I do this, I need to find out what countries have the most relevant information to make sure this correlation has some level of causation.

Let me know what you think! Thanks,
Robin
